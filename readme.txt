Overview:
The script codes of all modules have been provided in the CNDlP.R file, including the BAM generation code (process_map). BAM functional clustering code (Consensus clustering & Hypergeometric test), and calling the python interface of the Pharmacological prediction model in R for CNS prediction score ranking.

Dataset:
Folder 'test_raw_data' contains 'BAM_test' for runnning the Pharmacological prediction module to get the CNS prediction score ranking, 'raw_data_test' for running the process_map to generate the BAM of drug1 and 'DF.xlsx' contains the information of test drugs.
